# Churn-Prediction
A ride-sharing company is interested in predicting rider churn using a series of rider rating and behavior features. We'll explore this data, formulating questions to answer during the analysis, and provide a model to enable prediction of future rider churn events as well as infer the underlying characteristics that contribute to churn events. The business goal will then be to identify those likely to churn and take mitigating action either to company policy, or via targeted marketing. We'll see what the data tells us!
